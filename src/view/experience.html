                    <p class="text-md text-gray-600">January 2024 - Present</p>
                    <p class="text-lg">Currently, I teach mathematics and coach students for Olympiads at Urban School
                        #700 "Encarnaci√≥n Rosas". This role has allowed me to foster a love for mathematics among
                        students and help them prepare for various competitions. My approach focuses not only on
                        teaching mathematical concepts but also on developing critical thinking and problem-solving
                        skills. I have seen significant improvements in students' performance and their enthusiasm for
                        the subject.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg">During these periods, I worked as a speaker and problem solver, presenting
                        virtual reality (VR) projects to school audiences. My presentations aimed to introduce students
                        and educators to innovative teaching methods through VR technology. This role enhanced my public
                        speaking skills and my ability to convey complex ideas in an understandable way. It was
                        rewarding to see the excitement and interest that these new technologies sparked among students
                        and teachers alike.</p>
