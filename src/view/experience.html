                            School #700 "Encarnaci√≥n Rosas". This role has allowed me to foster a love for mathematics
                            among students and help them prepare for various competitions. My approach focuses not only
                            on teaching mathematical concepts but also on developing critical thinking and
                            problem-solving skills. I have seen significant improvements in students' performance and
                            their enthusiasm for the subject.</p>

                            enhanced my public speaking skills and my ability to convey complex ideas in an
                            understandable way. It was rewarding to see the excitement and interest that these new
